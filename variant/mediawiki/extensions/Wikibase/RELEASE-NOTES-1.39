=== Action API changes in 1.39 ===

* T104344: The wbsearchentities response has a new `display` field for each result. It may contain a `label` and `description` key.
Each of those will contain a `text` and a `language` key with the respective data.
The top-level `label`, `description` and `aliases` keys of each result are now considered deprecated and should no longer be used.

* (T12345) ...

=== Breaking changes in 1.39 ===

* (T114577) The maintenance script populateInterwiki.php was removed, use the same script from core.
* (T140850) The php entry point were removed, use wfLoadExtension instead.
* (T12345) ...

=== Deprecations in 1.39 ===

* (T312222) The LanguageFallbackLabelDescriptionLookupFactory service is deprecated.
Use the new FallbackLabelDescriptionLookupFactory service instead:
it has a very similar interface, but returns lookups that also resolve redirects.
