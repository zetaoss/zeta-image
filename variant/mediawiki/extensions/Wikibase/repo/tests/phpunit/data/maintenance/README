This directory contains test data for RDF format.

Please note that if you need to change any data for existing tests here,
you have probably made a change that is relevant to Wikidata Query Service
and other Linked Data/triple store consumers of Wikidata.
Such change should be announced on Wikidata list and usually the Phabricator
ticket should be created to update the Wikidata Query Service store.

A change that infuences RDF data is considered a "significant change"
within the terms of Wikidata Stable Interface Policy[1].
